<h1>Chatino</h1>
The Chatino keyboard for desktop, laptop, and mobile devices creates Unicode characters to represent tone marks for
the language. These tones are shown by the modifier characters that are superscript forms for "a" - "m". Capital values
also are available for all these except "C" and "F", which are not part of the Unicode Standard.
<p>
    To use the keyboard, KeyMan software must first be installed on the computer or mobile device. Then the Chatino layouts
    can be installed.
