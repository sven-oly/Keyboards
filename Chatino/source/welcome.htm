<h1>Start Using Chatino</h1>

<p>
    Chatino keyboard uses Unicode modifier letters for superscript tone markers. For desktop/laptop, the
    top row of keys on the default layer contain the lower case letters a-m, and the shifted layer has
    uppercase superscripts A-B, D-E, G-M (there are no Unicode upper case for "C" and "F").
<p>
A second layout provides the tone marks via a deadkey on the semicolon position. The tone marks are
entered by typing ";", then a key from a-m, which will select the uppercase tone marks. To use the 
lower case tone marks, simply type ; followed by uppercase A-M.
<p>To type a semicolon, enter ;;
<p>This keyboard also suppots Spanish characters á, é, etc., using the single quote key as a deadkey for the accented 
vowels and also ñ. To enter ü, use the colon key first, then the u.  Uppercase forms are entered with 
the uppercase letters after the dead key. To enter either the color or single quote, touch them twice.
<p>
  Chatino mobile uses long press on the keys A-M to select the superscript characters in both
  lower and upper case forms.
<p>
    The tone marks are standard Unicode values, which have the advantage over formatting styles because
    these characters are portable,
    i.e., they can be used in applications without needing to copy styles. These characters are present in most
    fonts that support the basic Latin letters, so the text is very portable.
</p>

<h1>Keyboard Layout</h1>
The basic keyboard layout is the same as standard QWERTY keyboards, with the exception of the top row, which is
used for the tone marks. The digits and standard punctuation are available on the control and shift-control layer of 
the keyboard.
